# ENVIRUS
Our project takes data from harmful air particles that is from transport,smoke from factories, and other sources of air pollution and predicts the air quality index. But predicting solely doesn't make sense so we also predict the pollution caused when we have the current scenario of traffic or smoke and when it is minimized by some percent. This in return will make the government aware of the reforms currently going on to make the environment more lively in terms of human health. So, suggesting ways to reduce the things which are harmful to the air. 

Traffic is the most important problem in India which is causing illness. Many people have reported acute respiratory problem. We need to manipulate traffic in that area so as to keep up the standards of AQI(Air Quality Index).
